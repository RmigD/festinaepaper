### Instructions (probably incomplete)
- Check the paths under /examples/getweathertoscreen.sh
- Check the paths under /examples/get_weather.py
- Install the fonts under "pic" if you wish to see them in the code.
- Provide your api key for darksky in file /examples/getweathertoscreen.sh
- Provide your api key for Pushbullet in file /examples/get_weather.py - I believe this needs fixing, but it has worked in the past.
- Cross fingers
- Run /examples/getweathertoscreen.sh
